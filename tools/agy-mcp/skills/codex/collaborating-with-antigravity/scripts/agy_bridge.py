"""Thin forwarder so the Claude skill can shell out to agy-bridge.

The skill is checked into Claude's user-scope skill directory and runs
in whatever Python the host environment provides. We don't ship the
agy-mcp package alongside the skill; instead we prefer ``uvx`` which
installs the wheel on demand from the user's pinned source.

Selection order:
  1. ``AGY_BRIDGE_CMD`` env var (full shell command, advanced override —
     **trust boundary**, see references/security.md).
  2. ``python -m agy_mcp.bridge`` if importable from the current env.
  3. ``uvx --from agy-mcp==<version> agy-bridge`` as the last-resort
     install-on-demand fallback. The pinned version resolves at module
     import time: when ``agy-mcp`` is installed, ``importlib.metadata``
     wins (so the wheel that hosts this script and the wheel that uvx
     fetches stay in sync). Otherwise the fallback literal kicks in —
     ``agy_mcp.install`` rewrites that literal at install time so a
     deployed copy carries a real version even on a wheel-less host.

All argv is forwarded verbatim. We do NOT parse the bridge response —
the caller (the Claude agent) reads the JSON line and decides what to do.
