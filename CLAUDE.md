# Core Safety & Environment Rules

## Project Detection
1. **Root Rule:** A "Project Root" is the nearest ancestor containing a `.git` folder, `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `requirements.txt`, or `go.mod`.
2. **Exception:** The home directory (`~`) is NOT a project root, even if it contains these files.
3. **Hierarchy:** If no project root is found, default to the current working directory, but NEVER initialize a git repository in `~` or its subdirectories (unless it's a known project folder in `~/projects/`).

## Core Rules
1. **Context:** Read `AG_CONTEXT.md` at the project root before ANY work. If missing, create it at the root. Update it with durable knowledge (bullets only) after significant architectural changes.
2. **Safety:** NEVER use `rm`. ALWAYS use `mv [path] ~/.Trash/` (Exception: `node_modules`).
3. **Tooling:** ALWAYS use `bun`. NEVER use `npm` or `pnpm`. If you start work on an existing project that uses npm, pnpm, or yarn, you MUST migrate it to Bun first (delete node_modules and old lockfiles, run `bun install`, and update package.json scripts) before starting your main task.
4. **Privacy:** ALL generated GitHub repos MUST use `--private`.
5. **No Repo in ~:** NEVER initialize a git repository in the home directory (`~`).
6. **Local Temp:** NEVER use system-level `/tmp`. ALWAYS create and use a `./tmp` folder within the current project directory for temporary files or test scripts to avoid permission prompts.
7. **Directory Consideration & Target Folders:** When asked to create files, utilities, or projects, NEVER litter them directly in generic parent directories (e.g. `~/projects` or a non-project root directory). First consider the current directory: if it is a generic container directory, you MUST create a dedicated sub-directory, move into it, and place all new files and initialize repositories inside that sub-directory.
   - **No-Workspace Fallback:** When running without an active workspace open, NEVER create projects inside `~/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/`. ALWAYS create new project directories in `~/projects/<project-name>`.

## Path Migration Guardrail
- **Context**: The host machine migrated from username `matthewmurphy` to `matt`.
- **Constraint**: When parsing, reading, creating, or writing absolute paths, files, scripts, or configuration settings:
  - ALWAYS translate paths containing `/Users/matthewmurphy/` to `/Users/matt/` (or use relative paths or `~/`).

# Git Protocol Rules

## Auto-Commit Protocol
- **Git Auto-Pull & Pre-Flight:** Before any agent begins work on an established git project, it MUST run `python3 /Users/matt/projects/ai-os/scripts/preflight.py` to perform all pre-flight routines (evaluating `ag-quota` velocity, auto-pulling/rebasing latest git changes, etc.) in a single step.
- **Auto-Commit:** Run `python3 /Users/matt/projects/ai-os/scripts/auto_commit.py` to delegate the commit process. Auto-commit automatically requires a descriptive commit message detailing the changes made (generated via LiteLLM from staged diff/files) and pushes the commits (`git push`) to the remote repository.

# Agent Work Logs & History

## Agent Work Logs Protocol
0. **Fresh Thread Context & Recent History:** When starting a new thread/session, scan the project root for `AG_CONTEXT.md`, `FEATURES.md`, `DEVELOPMENT_JOURNAL.md`, and `agent-logs/`. Read `DEVELOPMENT_JOURNAL.md` first, then inspect recent logs.
1. **Log Directory:** Maintain `agent-logs/` at the project root.
2. **Reading Logs:** Scan `agent-logs/` for related past work before starting.
3. **Writing Logs:** At the END of every session with code changes, create `agent-logs/YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM_<description>.md`.
4. **Development Journal:** Append a 2-3 line bullet entry to `DEVELOPMENT_JOURNAL.md` at the project root at the end of every session.

## Claude Code / Hermes CLI Specific Rules

- **Mandatory Preflight (Always):** At the VERY START of every session — before ANY code reading, editing, or research — run `python3 /Users/matt/projects/ai-os/scripts/preflight.py`. Do not skip this even if you think you ran it recently. This runs `ag-quota`, git pull/rebase, rules bundle, and thread bloat check in a single step.
- **Mandatory Auto-Commit (Always):** At the END of every session (or when a complete logical change is done), run `python3 /Users/matt/projects/ai-os/scripts/auto_commit.py` to stage, commit, and push changes. Do not skip this.
- **Interactive Handoff & Spawn**: Never run agents blind (do not use `--non-interactive`, `--print`, or background execution without attachment). Handoffs must be run interactively to allow the user to review the plan and steering instructions. The handoff command MUST execute the `handover.py` script, which replaces the current process (`os.execvp("agy", ...)`) to attach the interactive `agy` CLI session directly to your terminal. Execute the handoff by running:
  `python3 /Users/matt/projects/ai-os/scripts/handover.py --to-model pro --completed "<what you analyzed/researched>" --next-steps "<what needs to be done next>"`
- **Exclusively Use agy for Subagents**: When agy quota is high/abundant, use agy exclusively. If a prompt goes to Hermes (default), use the MCP tool to spawn a tmux-bound `agy` CLI instance as a subagent, or if already in agy, have agy spin up its own subagent natively. Do not spawn external API agents or run subagents without attaching/steering capabilities.
