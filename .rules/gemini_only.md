## Gemini / Antigravity Specific Rules

- **Mandatory Synchronous Preflight & Waiting:** Agents MUST run preflight at the start of every session, wait for it to complete synchronously, and respect its findings. Agents MUST NEVER force Jules without asking the user first.

## Flash-Lite Edit Delegation (Antigravity Native)
- **Rule:** When running in Antigravity, the top-level orchestrator agent MUST **never write or modify files directly** using `write_to_file`, `replace_file_content`, or `multi_replace_file_content` itself. Instead, it MUST delegate ALL file creation and editing operations to a `flash_lite` subagent. The orchestrator agent MUST NOT fall back to or use `Model: "flash"`; `flash_lite` is the strictly enforced requirement.
- **How:** To definitively prevent recursive subagent loops, the orchestrator MUST physically restrict the subagent's tools:
  1. Call `define_subagent` with `name: "file_editor"`, `enable_write_tools: true`, and CRUCIALLY `enable_subagent_tools: false`. Include a `system_prompt` explicitly telling it that it is a leaf agent and MUST edit files directly.
  2. Spawn the subagent via `invoke_subagent` using `TypeName: "file_editor"` and `Model: "flash_lite"`. Pass a fully self-contained prompt with the exact target file path(s), precise instructions, and sufficient context.
  *(Note: Because `enable_subagent_tools` is false, the child agent physically lacks the `invoke_subagent` tool, breaking any recursion loop at the system level.)*
- **Exceptions** (orchestrator may edit directly):
  1. The task is **planning-only** (producing an artifact/plan with no source code changes).
  2. The user explicitly instructs the orchestrator to make edits directly (e.g. "do it yourself", "edit it directly").
  3. The edit is a single-character or trivially obvious fix (e.g. fixing a typo the user just pointed out inline).
- **Batching:** Batch all related file edits into a **single** subagent invocation. Do not spawn one subagent per file.
- **Verification:** After the subagent reports completion, run `git diff` once to verify. Do not re-read files unless the diff reveals something unexpected.

## Post-Edit Reload Protocol
- **Hammerspoon Reload Rule:** Whenever you modify any source/Lua file in `qwerty-midi-hammerspoon` (or projects using Hammerspoon bundles), you MUST immediately run `bash /Users/matt/projects/qwerty-midi-hammerspoon/bin/bundle_and_reload.sh` as a mandatory post-flight step before concluding your turn or declaring the task done.

## Hermes Operational Emulation & Self-Improvement Protocol (Antigravity Only)
When running under Gemini/Antigravity without Hermes' active daemon, you MUST emulate Hermes' core runtime directives:

1. **Tool-Use Enforcement**:
   - You MUST use tools to take action — never describe what you plan to do without executing it in the same turn.
   - Responses that only describe intentions ("I will run the tests", "Let me inspect the file") without accompanying tool calls are prohibited.

2. **Task Completion & Anti-Fabrication**:
   - Deliverables must be working artifacts backed by real tool execution output, not prose summaries.
