# Agent Work Logs & History

## Agent Work Logs Protocol
0. **Fresh Thread Context & Recent History:** When starting a new thread/session, scan the project root for `AG_CONTEXT.md`, `FEATURES.md`, `DEVELOPMENT_JOURNAL.md`, and `agent-logs/`. Read `DEVELOPMENT_JOURNAL.md` first, then inspect recent logs.
1. **Log Directory:** Maintain `agent-logs/` at the project root.
2. **Reading Logs:** Scan `agent-logs/` for related past work before starting.
3. **Writing Logs:** At the END of every session with code changes, create `agent-logs/YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM_<description>.md`.
4. **Development Journal:** Append a 2-3 line bullet entry to `DEVELOPMENT_JOURNAL.md` at the project root at the end of every session.
5. **Mandatory Wiki Recording:** Any significant architectural decision, optimization pattern, structural change, or system directive update MUST be recorded in the local LLM Wiki engine (`wiki-engine`) or project context files before concluding the turn.

## Master Project Board Protocol
- **Single Source of Truth**: Active multi-project backlog is maintained in `/Users/matt/projects/ai-os/PROJECT_BOARD.md` (synced with Obsidian `Personal/Development/Project Notes/Global Todos.md`).
- **Hydration & Visibility**: `preflight.py` automatically hydrates in-progress and top backlog items at the start of every session.
- **Surfacing Requirement**: Agents MUST surface clickable links (`[PROJECT_BOARD.md](file:///Users/matt/projects/ai-os/PROJECT_BOARD.md)`) with 1-click action links whenever initiating new features or concluding tasks.
- **Task Schema**: Always format tasks as `- [ ] <description> [project:: <id>] [assignee:: user|agent] [due:: YYYY-MM-DD]`.
