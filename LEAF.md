# Core Safety & Environment Rules

## Project Detection
1. **Root Rule:** A "Project Root" is the nearest ancestor containing a `.git` folder, `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `requirements.txt`, or `go.mod`.
4. **Subdirectory Git Detection:** Scripts and agents must ALWAYS detect git repository roots using `git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree` and `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` instead of checking `os.path.exists(".git")` in the current working directory.
2. **Exception:** The home directory (`~`) is NOT a project root, even if it contains these files.
3. **Hierarchy:** If no project root is found, default to the current working directory, but NEVER initialize a git repository in `~` or its subdirectories (unless it's a known project folder in `~/projects/`).

## Core Rules
1. **Context:** Read `AG_CONTEXT.md` at the project root before ANY work. If missing, create it at the root. Update it with durable knowledge (bullets only) after significant architectural changes.
2. **Safety:** NEVER use `rm`. ALWAYS use `mv [path] ~/.Trash/` (Exception: `node_modules`).
3. **Tooling:** ALWAYS use `bun`. NEVER use `npm` or `pnpm`. If you start work on an existing project that uses npm, pnpm, or yarn, you MUST migrate it to Bun first (delete node_modules and old lockfiles, run `bun install`, and update package.json scripts) before starting your main task.
4. **Privacy:** ALL generated GitHub repos MUST use `--private`.
5. **No Repo in ~:** NEVER initialize a git repository in the home directory (`~`).
6. **Local Temp:** NEVER use system-level `/tmp`. ALWAYS create and use a `./tmp` folder within the current project directory for temporary files or test scripts to avoid permission prompts.
7. **Directory Consideration & Target Folders:** When asked to create files, utilities, or projects, NEVER litter them directly in generic parent directories (e.g. `~/projects` or a non-project root directory). First consider the current directory: if it is a generic container directory, you MUST create a dedicated sub-directory, move into it, and place all new files and initialize repositories inside that sub-directory.
   - **No-Workspace Fallback:** When running without an active workspace open, NEVER create projects inside `~/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/`. ALWAYS create new project directories in `~/projects/<project-name>`.

## Path Migration Guardrail
- **Context**: The host machine migrated from username `matthewmurphy` to `matt`.
- **Constraint**: When parsing, reading, creating, or writing absolute paths, files, scripts, or configuration settings:
  - ALWAYS translate paths containing `/Users/matthewmurphy/` to `/Users/matt/` (or use relative paths or `~/`).

# User Personal To-Dos & Apple Reminders Protocol
- **Constraint**: Whenever Matt mentions personal to-dos, future follow-ups, calls to make (e.g., "I'll call them Monday"), reminders, or requests to track tasks for himself:
  - Agents MUST IMMEDIATELY execute the `apple-reminders` CLI in the same turn (`apple-reminders add --title "..." --due "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM" --notes "..."`) with intelligent due dates, contact numbers, and relevant identifiers pre-populated in the notes.
  - Agents should proactively offer to break down overwhelming or multi-step tasks into small, low-friction subtasks in Apple Reminders.
  - Do NOT create orphaned markdown to-do files in random locations that won't be actively checked on mobile.

# Proactive System Directive & Knowledge Persistence
- **Rule**: When Matt establishes a permanent workflow preference, tool routing rule, or operational invariant (e.g. "always do X from now on" or "agents must know this in every thread"):
  - Agents MUST NOT bury it in an obscure notes file that won't be read.
  - Agents MUST immediately update the single-source rules under `~/projects/ai-os/.rules/` and run `python3 ~/projects/ai-os/scripts/build_rules.py` so the directive is compiled into `GEMINI.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `HERMES.md` across every future session.

# Zero-Placeholder Policy & User Context Auto-Population
- **Rule**: Agents MUST NEVER emit generic user placeholders (e.g. `[Your Name]`, `[Your Student ID]`, `[Your CCID]`, `[Your Email]`, `[Insert Date]`) in templates, email drafts, forms, or scripts when the information exists in the project context or personal vault.
- **Auto-Lookup**: Agents must search and auto-populate all known identifiers and personal metadata directly:
  - Full Name: `Matthew Daniel Murphy` (Matt)
  - U of A Student ID: `1981495`
  - CCID: `mdmurphy` (`mdmurphy@ualberta.ca`)
  - Alberta Student Number (ASN): `3069-4370-5`
  - Program: `B.Sc. Major in Computing Science / Artificial Intelligence Concentration`

# Architectural Preservation & Non-Destructive Debugging Policy
- **Rule**: When debugging, fixing formatting bugs, or refactoring established custom code, UI layouts, CSS architectures, or templates (e.g. `thread.md` styles, pure-CSS flex hacks, container queries, custom DOM structures):
  - Agents MUST NEVER unilaterally scrap, strip out, "simplify", or replace custom styling and architecture with barebones alternatives.
  - Agents MUST isolate and fix the exact root cause (e.g. string sanitization, unescaped quotes, regex edge cases, tag boundary spacing, markdown blank lines) while strictly preserving all existing styling, DOM structures, and visual design patterns.
  - **Strict Span-Only Styling Invariant**: For `thread.md`, conversation artifacts, and custom markdown layouts, agents MUST use `<span>` tags exclusively (with `display: block;`, `white-space: pre-wrap;`, and inline CSS) for all layout and styling containers. NEVER use `<div>`, `<p>`, or other block HTML tags. Use `<br>` or `<br><br>` tags within `<span>` to preserve line breaks and paragraph spacing without breaking out of the inline span container.
  - Any architectural redesign, style simplification, or structural removal requires explicit user request and approval.

## Strict Planner / Workflow Immediate Dispatch
- **Rule**: When the user's prompt includes a planner workflow directive (e.g. `/_plan-with-ai-os` or `@planner`), the orchestrator MUST NOT perform ad-hoc grep/file searches or exploratory investigation on its own.
- **Workflow**: Immediately run the single planner command via `run_command` (using `node ~/projects/ai-os/scripts/query_aios.js --plan "<request>"`) with `WaitMsBeforeAsync: 500`. This is a **unified single-step command** that automatically: inspects Git context, reads agent logs, generates `./tmp/planner_prompt.txt`, dispatches to Perplexity (Grok Thinking), and writes the completed plan to `./tmp/planner_output.txt`. There is NO separate `generate_prompt.py` step — do NOT run any such script.
- **Strict Perplexity Dispatch & Fallback Policy**: When `/_plan-with-ai-os` is invoked, the orchestrator MUST ONLY dispatch via `run_command` (using `node ~/projects/ai-os/scripts/query_aios.js --plan "<request>"`). Never use Gemini 3.1 Pro for planning for any reason. Fall back to `agy` ONLY if Perplexity quota is 0, or if Matt specifically requests it; and when falling back to `agy`, ALWAYS use `Gemini 3.7 Flash (High)` for planning, NEVER 3.1 Pro.
- **ECONNREFUSED / Timeout Recovery — MANDATORY EXACT STEPS**:
  1. If `query_aios.js` outputs `ECONNREFUSED` or times out, do NOT run any diagnostic commands (`pgrep`, `la status`, `grep`, etc.). IMMEDIATELY run the recover command:
     `node ~/projects/ai-os/scripts/query_aios.js --recover --output ./tmp/planner_output.txt --timeout 300`
  2. If the recover command also fails with ECONNREFUSED, the ai-os companion is not running. Restart it with: `la start agy-proxy` and then retry the original plan command.
  3. NEVER grep for port numbers, NEVER run `la status` without a name argument, NEVER run `pgrep` to diagnose connection failures. The only two valid responses to ECONNREFUSED are `--recover` and `la start agy-proxy`.

# Custom Skills Naming & Authoring Invariant
- **Rule**: When creating, authoring, or refactoring personal/custom skills for Matt in `~/projects/ai-os/skills/` or environment skill directories:
  - **Leading Underscore Namespace (`_`)**: ALL user-authored/custom skills MUST begin with a leading underscore (`_`) prefix so they sort to the very top of alphabetical listings, IDE pickers, and autocomplete popovers.
  - **Action-First Semantic Naming (`_<action>-<constraint>`)**: Skill names MUST start with the primary action verb, followed by the defining behavioral constraint or modifier (e.g., `_critique-without-ghostwriting`, `_prune-subtractively`).
  - **Auto-Sync Invariant**: After creating or updating any skill under `~/projects/ai-os/skills/`, agents MUST immediately execute `python3 /Users/matt/projects/ai-os/scripts/sync_skills.py` to propagate changes across all local agent runtimes (`~/.hermes`, `~/.gemini`, `~/.claude`, `~/.agents`).

# Subagent Rules

1. **Execution Only**: Strictly execute the plan provided by the orchestrator.
2. **Direct Edits**: When acting as a file editor, use write tools directly. Avoid recursive spawning.
3. **Reporting**: Conclude with a clear diff or summary of changes so the orchestrator can easily verify.
