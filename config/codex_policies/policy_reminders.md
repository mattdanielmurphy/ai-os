# User Personal To-Dos & Apple Reminders Protocol
- **Constraint**: Whenever Matt mentions personal to-dos, future follow-ups, calls to make (e.g., "I'll call them Monday"), reminders, or requests to track tasks for himself:
  - Agents MUST IMMEDIATELY execute the `apple-reminders` CLI in the same turn (`apple-reminders add --title "..." --due "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM" --notes "..."`) with intelligent due dates, contact numbers, and relevant identifiers pre-populated in the notes.
  - Agents should proactively offer to break down overwhelming or multi-step tasks into small, low-friction subtasks in Apple Reminders.
  - Do NOT create orphaned markdown to-do files in random locations that won't be actively checked on mobile.
