# Personal AI OS - Custom Workspace Rules

## Username & Path Migration Guardrail
- **Context**: The host machine migrated from username `matthewmurphy` to `matt`.
- **Constraint**: When parsing, reading, creating, or writing absolute paths, files, scripts, or configuration settings:
  - ALWAYS translate paths containing `/Users/matthewmurphy/` to `/Users/matt/` (or use relative paths or the active home directory reference `~/` / `std::env::var("HOME")` where appropriate).
  - Pay special attention to symbolic links, environment setups, or hardcoded scripts that may still reference the legacy username and correct them on discovery.
